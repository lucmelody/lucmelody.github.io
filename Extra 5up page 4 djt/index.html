										With the usual drama with the presidential election for the United States of America, a new, outspoken, candidate has joined the “race” for president: Donald Trump. A man who seems at a glance like a racist, but who is gaining votes. The media is baffled, which, if you look to investigate, makes them (the media) look nothing short of naive. 

										Donald Trump isn’t a racist, his supporters are. If you look back to when Donald Trump had just arrived from Brooklyn, having swarmed the property market there, much to the delight of his father, he began to be asked by reporters about his future. Donald Trump quoted on a media report (courtesy of the Oprah Winfrey Show): “I think Mr Bush stands a good chance of winning the presidential election”. Donald Trump was correct, and was already of thinking to run for president at the time, shown by the quote: “Well I’ll tell you what, I think I would win”, which,  horrifyingly seems, to be the case int the 2016 elections. Or is it as bad as it seems? 

										Sure Trump insults many groups of voters, though these are minorities. These minorities only are a percentage of his vote, leaving most of the majority (many of them siding with Mr. Trump) not being offended. Along with Sarah Palin, a familiar face in the northern state of Alaska, Trump has the ability to gain a majority support. Plus, Donald Trump isn’t insulting majority ethnic minorities in the US. One example would be the “Colombian Americans”, who are one of the more conservative ethnic minorities (allowing him to persuade a group of potential supporters easier).   

										One of the many thing a candidate for the United Stated Presidential Elections, is opponents. One of the “clichés” of the presidential race, are the “rows” on live television. These events can win supporters, if you stay calm, that is. But, we are referring to Trump, who has an opposite campaign features than any other candidate (Republican or Democrat). Mr. Trump’s speeches involve nicknames for the other candidates, such as “Lying Ted” ( a nickname for Ted Cruz), or even “Crooked Hillary” (a nickname for Hillary Clinton). The idea behind the act is to force Trump’s supporters to block response to statements, shown by a video on YouTube. Cruz attempts to reply to a statement made by a Trump supporter, though is blocked off. The crowd of supporters shout: “Lying Ted!”, one, and over again. Meaning that everyone comes out of the argument, except Cruz himself (since everyone else involved were Trump supporters), having the same political mindset when the began the argument with Rubio. This allows Trump not to loose supporters, while also getting  to create arguments (more often than not rude) towards Donald Trump’s opponent’s. You could almost see it as a franchise, where the price if having to be a Trump supporter.

										Many (if not all) candidates came in with money for marketing and other affairs, but many are spending money to quickly. All but one, of course, yours truly, Donald J Trump. Trump has free marketing, due to his racist and outspoken speeches and, what can seem to be, outrageously outspoken views. But all he is doing is gaining free support, via getting himself on news reports. Not only that, but getting gossip on worldwide political shows (such as a role-play on the Jimmy Fallon Show). All of this saves money, and in-turn allows for more spending for other forms of advertising (such as buses, planes (of course his Boeing 757 (branded with the word Trump on the fuselage), billboards and large venues.

										Many people are prepared to leave the United States is Donald Trump wins the election, but we may see a change in spirits. He began his run with the quote: “We're going to cherish the Second Amendment!” (a law allowing a civilian to have (and safely) use a weapon legally), though has completely changed his opinion, to: “The one thing dragging down this country is warfare.” These two opposite views lean towards the notion of Trump softening his career, which may be suicide. As I said before Donald Trump isn’t a racist, even his wife (which admittedly is one of three spouses he has had) Mexican. If he is racist his wife most likely would, have left him. But if Mr. Trump were to soften his campaign, he risks being left by his supporter. 

										To conclude this analysis, Donald Trump has gained supporters by acting like a right winged politician. Though, he has to show his true view. If he wishes not to, he may risk having angry supporters. If he this occurs during presidency, he may risk having a rebellion. Either way Donald J Trump is standing two dangerous road, which one will he now take?
